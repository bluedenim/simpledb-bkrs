/**
 * Given a list of records, this class is used to iterate each record (via a call to
 * {@link #accumulate(Object)}) and aggregate them into instances of T. A new instance of T is
 * created when a new K is detected in the records accumulated.
 * <br>
 * Accumulators can be chained to build up sub-collections.
 * <br>
 * NOTE that rows MUST BE ordered/grouped by keys as calculated by the key extraction closure since
 * a change in the key is interpreted as the end of the current T and the beginning of a
 * new instance.
 * <br>
 * Example of a set of records for (ID, firstName, lastName, dish):
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 *     1, Slim, Joe, Chicken
 *     1, Slim, Joe, Chicken
 *     2, Portly, Bob, Steak
 *     2, Portly, Bob, Fish
 *     2, Portly, Bob, Spinach
 * }
 * </pre>
 * An accumulator can be used to model a Person entity based on the first 3 fields, then an
 * accumulator can be chained to model a Dish entity which appends to the dishes collection
 * of the Person entity. The result can be:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Person: {1, Joe Slim} with a collection of Dish: {Chicken}</li>
 *     <li>Person: {2, Bob Portly} with a collection of Dish: {Steak, Fish, Spinach}</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * @param <P> the type of the parent entity (for chaining)
 * @param <T> the type of the entity to build off of the rows
 * @param <R> the type of the rows
 * @param <K> the type of the key used to partition the rows corresponding to an entity
